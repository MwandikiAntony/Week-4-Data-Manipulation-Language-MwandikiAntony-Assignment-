# Week 4: Expense Tracker Management with Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Great work last week! With just a little more practice you will be an expert at retrieving and summarizing your expense data. This week, we'll dive into Data Manipulation Language (DML), empowering you to actively manage your Expense Tracker project.

## Learning Objectives:

Master INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements for data manipulation in your Expense Tracker.
Confidently add new expenses, update existing ones, and remove unwanted entries.
Understand and handle NULL values effectively in your database.

**What you'll need:**

Access to a computer with internet access
A text editor (e.g., Notepad, Google Docs)
Access to your Expense Tracker database (instructor-provided data)
Important Note: It's recommended to practice on a copy of your Expense Tracker database to avoid accidental modifications to your main data set.

 ## Questions (2 hours):

**1.1.** Adding Multiple Expenses: 
Write an INSERT statement to add several new expense records to your Expense Tracker at once. Include details like amount, date, and category (e.g., record grocery purchases, office supplies, and travel costs for a specific date with their respective amounts). Consider using multiple VALUES clauses within a single INSERT statement for efficiency.

**1.2.** Updating Expense Information:
Modify an existing expense record in your Expense Tracker. You can change details like the amount, date, or category for a specific expense ID. Demonstrate the use of a WHERE clause to target the exact record you want to update.

**1.3.** Selective Data Deletion
Create a copy of your "Expenses" table. Practice deleting records using DELETE on this copy, focusing on entries with specific criteria. Here are a couple of options:

* Delete expense entries where the amount is zero.
* Delete expense entries from a specific date range (e.g., delete all expenses before July 1st, 2023).
**Remember:**  Perform these deletions on your copy to avoid modifying your main data set.

## Bonus Challenge: Handling NULL Values

Handling NULL Values:  
Check if there are any NULL values in your "Expenses" table. If so, explore how you might handle them using conditional updates or setting default values. Consider the feasibility of these approaches based on your sample data.
